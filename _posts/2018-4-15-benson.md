### Looking Back on My First Week at Metis

##### April 9, 2018
 
Hi everyone! I have just completed my first week at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in New York. I wanted to take some 
time to reflect on my experience and write about our first project. 

The first week of the program was exciting and a bit overwhelming. There was a ton of information being thrown our way,
plenty of new faces to meet, and a new schedule and space to get accustomed to. However, here I am posting about it so
I'd say it was a success. 

The first project, known as Project Benson, was a team project and I worked with three of my fellow students. We were
given a business task in which an organization known as WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) needed help leveraging data in order 
to find the best subway stations in the city to place their street teams. The street teams would attempt to gather 
signatures and emails from individuals interested in attending and supporting WTWY's summer gala, particularly women working in the technology sector. 
We were given extensive [MTA Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) for our exploration and analysis. My group also 
decided to use [NYC Census Data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/new-york-city-census-data/data) to aid in our 
investigation.

#### *Data Collection and Preprocessing*

After importing six weeks of data from the MTA's website, we were ready to get going. Each dataset
includes turnstile entry and exit counts collected every four hours for one week. This consists of
every single turnstile grouped into various C/A (Control Areas) and UNIT (Remote units for subway stations).
The data also lists the actual station names, lines that the station serves, and the exact date and 
time of collection.

The first issue we ran into is the fact that the data gave us the cumulative counts of the turnstile
entries and exits. We needed to get the noncumulative counts in order to break down our analysis further
by Unit, Station, C/A, time of day, day of week, etc. This was achieved using
 [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/), the powerful data analysis package for 
Python. We also found it useful to throw out any major outliers that might have skewed our analysis.
Any turnstile that happened to have over 14,000 entries or exits per four hour period (that is approximately 1 swipe 
per second), was discarded from our dataset.

#### *Results*

The first figure shows the top ten subway stations by average foot traffic. This was calculated by 
taking the average of the sum of the entries and sum of the exits for each station.

The six plots below show total entries at the WallST 4, 5 station on a daily basis over the span 
of six weeks.

It is interesting to note the dips in traffic on the weekends and certain Wednesdays. Thursday 
universally seems to be the day of the week with the highest amount of turnstile entries, at least at
the Wall ST. subway stop. Fridays also seem to be a lighter day compared to the rest of the work week.

Figure 1 clearly shows the major hubs of New York City and which stations get the most foot traffic 
overall. It would likely be beneficial to place street teams at some of these hubs on busier days 
of the week. 

Further analysis led our team to binning the data into four hour intervals throughout the day and finding 
out which time periods were the busiest at the hubs. We also brought in the NYC Census Data to find out 
which areas of the city women in technology were likely to be living in. By finding out which 
neighborhoods these women reside in and which major subway stations they were likely to pass through on 
a daily basis, our group was able to come to a better conclusion about the optimal placement of the 
street teams.
