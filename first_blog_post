### Looking Back on My First Week at Metis 

Hi everyone! I have just completed my first week at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp in New York. I wanted to take some 
time to reflect on my experience and write about our first project. 

The first week of the program was exciting and a bit overwhelming. There was a ton of information being thrown our way,
plenty of new faces to meet, and a new schedule and space to get accustomed to. However, here I am posting about it so
I'd say it was a success. 

The first project, known as Project Benson, was a team project and I worked with three of my fellow students. We were
given a business task in which an organization known as WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) needed help leveraging data in order 
to find the best subway stations in the city to place their street teams. The street teams would attempt to gather 
signatures and emails from individuals interested in attending and supporting WTWY's summer gala. We were given extensive
[MTA Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) for our exploration and analysis. My group also 
decided to use [NYC Census Data](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/new-york-city-census-data/data) to aid in our 
investigation.
